React.js Technical Test
 
Task 1: Component Creation and State Management
 
Create a React component called Counter that displays a number and two buttons - "Increment" and "Decrement".
Implement the functionality so that clicking "Increment" increases the displayed number, and clicking "Decrement" decreases it.
Ensure that the number cannot go below zero.
 
Task 2: Form Handling and Validation

Task 5: Bonus (Optional)
 
Optional - Ensure the layout of your code responds to the width of the screen (e.g. desktop width to mobile screen width), design will be of your own choice of arrangement and a brief description of why
 
Create a public GitHub repository for your solution.
